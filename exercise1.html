    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Short bio</h2>
    <p>
      I’m Ebenezar Ampofo, an Informatics major at UMass Amherst with a
      focus on business data science. I’m interested in data analysis,
      cybersecurity, and building tools that make people’s lives easier.
    </p>

    <h2>Longer bio</h2>
    <p>
      I’m Ebenezar Ampofo (I also go by Eben), a junior Informatics student at
      UMass Amherst, concentrating in business data science. I enjoy working at
      the intersection of technology and people especially where data, systems,
      and user experience come together.
    </p>

    <p>
      Career-wise, I’m exploring roles like data analyst, business analyst, UX
      designer, and software developer. I like projects where I can take messy
      information, organize it into something clear, and use it to make better
      decisions or build better products.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of school, I’m also into content creation and barbering, which has
      taught me consistency, communication, and attention to detail.
